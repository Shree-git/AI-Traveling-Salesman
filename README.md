# AI-Traveling-Salesman

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem.

The following program uses genetic algorithm to figure out the optimal solution to the TSP. There are 3 main parameters in the program that the user can tweak: Number of cities, Number of generations, and the Size of the population.

One can run the script **graphicaltsp.py**.
OR
Run the graphicaltsp.exe file inside of the dist folder if one is using a Windows machine.
